This is my application for TapBlaze. Any questions please email rkyle6676@gmail.com

As for the testing. The winnning sector can be forced on the Wheel Script 
by setting the Debug_flag and selecting a number between 1-8 in Force_win_sector. 
The wheel script is connected to the wheel object, a child of the Full Wheel object.

The unit testing can be found in Assets/Tests. The test is called Test_Wheel_WheelTest.
There are other unit tests in there testing various error checkers and other features.

Here is a video of it working on a phone. Since it is just an application, I decided to upload it to itch.io.
Although, this may have resulted in the mobile demonstration being massively slowed down (Either that or the animated glowing gif)
and thus the video, while showing the wheel works, is much slower than when I ran it on PC.
